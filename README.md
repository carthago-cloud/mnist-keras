# A simple convolutional network in Keras for the MNIST dataset

### Environment setup

For non-MacOs users create a virtual environment as follows:

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For MacOs users use `requirements_macos.txt` instead.

### Model

To execute a basic routine (creating, training, evaluating) run:

```
python cnn_mnist_keras.py
```
